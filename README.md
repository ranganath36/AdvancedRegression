## General Information
Problem Statement - US-based housing company Surprise Housing has entered the Australian market. The company wants to uses data analytics on the data collected by the company from the sale of house in Australia. Using this the company wants to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. The requirement is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

From this modelling we need to know:

    1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
    2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Business Goal for the company - The above model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns
